# Predict-property-maintenance-fines

Modified from the final assignment from the Applied Machine Learning in Python course. I built classification models using Random Forest and XGBoost to predict whether property maintenance fines would be paid on time. I built a customized trasformer with pipeline to validate the models without data leakage. 

The files can be viewed in a Jupyter Notebook or in a html format. I don't recommend reruning the notebook on your machine, because the dataset is large, and thus training the models takes significant amount of time.
